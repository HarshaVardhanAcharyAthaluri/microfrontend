# microfrontend
The term "Micro Front-ends" has been a buzzword for breaking up growing front-end code into easy-to-maintain parts. The front-end is divided into its multiple functions or parts. These parts are implemented and deployed by independent teams. This increases the testability, reusability, and offers the possibility to select different technologies for each micro front-end.
